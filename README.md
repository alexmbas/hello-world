"This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow."
A bit about myself: We are learning the basics of Github and eventually Git (On Windows) and then working through TheOdinProject as well as FreeCodeCamp. Odin for the theory/deeper meanings, and FCC for the hands on exercises. I'm also going through a school program on full stack web development at the same time, oddly enough, i've found TOP and FCC to make more sense than most of my College Curriculum, ah well! Get that piece of paper!
